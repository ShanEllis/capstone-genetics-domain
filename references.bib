	abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html.},

	abstract = {The apparently large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness presents a formidable puzzle. Unlike common physical disorders, mental illness usually has an onset early in the reproductive age and is associated with substantial reproductive disadvantage. Therefore, genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness should be under strong negative selection pressure and be eliminated from the genetic pool through natural selection. Still, mental disorders are common and twin studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to their aetiology. Several theories have been advanced to explain the paradox of high heritability and reproductive disadvantage associated with the same common phenotype, but none provides a satisfactory explanation for all types of mental illness. At the same time, identification of the molecular substrate underlying the large genetic contribution to the aetiology of mental illness is proving more difficult than expected. The quest for genetic variants associated with vulnerability to mental illness is predicated upon the common disease/common variant (CDCV) hypothesis. On the basis of a summary of evidence, it is concluded that the CDCV hypothesis is untenable for most types of mental illness. An alternative evolution-informed framework is proposed, which suggests that gene–environment interactions and rare genetic variants constitute most of the genetic contribution to mental illness. Common mental illness with mild reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large contribution from interactions between common genetic variants and environmental exposures. Severe mental illness that confers strong reproductive disadvantage is likely to have a large and pleiotropic contribution from rare variants of recent origin. This framework points to a need for a paradigm change in genetic research to enable major progress in elucidating the aetiology of mental illness.},

	abstract = {Metabolomics is a recently developed technique for the analysis of the small-molecule component of biological systems and samples. Metabolites consist of a very heterogeneous group of organic small molecules, including organic acids, amino acids, sugars, phosphosugars, steroids, and biogenic amines. Because of this diversity, many technologies have been applied to metabolomics. These technologies are based primarily on sensitive spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that are capable of the simultaneous detection and quantitation of metabolites in the hundreds (nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and thousands (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Metabolite analysis techniques can be split into fingerprinting (diagnostic patterns of disease), profiling (quantitative analysis of large numbers of metabolites), pool analysis (targeted quantitation of a smaller number of metabolites), and flux analysis (tracing metabolite fate and calculation of rates of metabolic processes). They must be subjected to complex data analysis to test or generate hypotheses, followed by contextualization via metabolic pathway analysis. Metabolomics has already become a valuable “omics” technology that complements genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.},

Other issues to consider in experimental design include the quality of the antibodies and the depth of sequencing.Genome alignment and the identification of enriched regions present challenges for data analysis, and there are several strategies available.Owing to increased genome coverage, a substantial fraction of the repetitive regions in the genome can now be examined.Increased sensitivity and specificity in the mapping of transcription factor binding sites has facilitated motif discovery and target identification.Detailed profiling of histone modifications and nucleosome positions enables greater understanding of epigenetic mechanisms in development and differentiation.As the cost of sequencing continues to decrease, ChIP–seq will be the method of choice over array-based approaches in nearly all cases.},
