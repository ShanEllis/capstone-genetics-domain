# Week 5: RNA-Seq: Normalization & DEA

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Expression Normalization 
* Differential Expression Analysis

## Reading

Please read the following:
* **Replication Paper**: Ramaker et al. *Genome Medicine* (2017) {cite}`ramaker_post-mortem_2017` [[URL](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0458-5)]; [[PDF](https://github.com/ShanEllis/capstone-genetics-domain/raw/master/papers/main-paper.pdf)]
    * Methods: Sequencing data analysis - stop at Pathway enrichment analysis 
    * Results: Beginning - stop at Cell type-specific changes
* DESeq2: Love et al. *Genome Biology* (2014) [[URL](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)]; [[PDF](https://github.com/ShanEllis/capstone-genetics-domain/raw/master/papers/week5/DESeq2.pdf)]
