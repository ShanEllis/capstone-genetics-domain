# Genetic Basis of Mental Health

Data science capstone (https://dsc-capstone.github.io/) genetic basis of mental health domain of inquiry (DSC 180 B04).

Developed by Shannon E. Ellis


## Introduction

This domain centers around analyzing genetic sequencing data to better understand the etiology and genetic basis of major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD).

## Result Replication

The bulk of the first half of the project will focus on analyzing RNA-Sequencing data. 

Specifically, you all will be reproducing (or modifying/surpassing) the results in this paper:
* [Post-mortem molecular profiling of three psychiatric disorders](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0458-5)

This implies *at a minimum* reproducing Figure 1 in this paper {cite}`ramaker_post-mortem_2017`.

The latter-half of DSC180A will introduce you to methods, techniques, and concepts that will help you move beyond, brainstorm, and develop a project that moves beyond this first replication.

## Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
[schedule](#schedule). Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of the assigned readings.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions on the Google Form by Tuesday at 11:59PM. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. You are responsible for the entire weekly reading, even if portions are not covered in the weekly discussions/questions, as these are designed to help you in your replication.
