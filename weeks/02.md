## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions on this week's [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3KZSpPM7ZenKBa8pMxSTmK6iXrWR2HwLNjU6sGRDfctc44Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Possible Discussion Topics

These are generated from common student questions/themes students identified from the readings:

- What is the CDCV Hypothesis?
- How is inheritance calculated? And, what's this about paternal inheritance playing a larger role here?
- What exactly is the relationship between inheritance and mental illness? Where does environment fit in?
- Applications? What's after GWAS? How do we use this framework? Next steps? 

## Student Q&A

Student responses on the Google Form: [Summary](https://shanellis.github.io/capstone-genetics-domain/responses/02.html)

Answers to a few student questions:

Q1: **Are we going to be learning more about RNA-Seq or should I start learning on my own?**  
A1: Yes! This will be the focus of a coming week of discussion and we'll be doing a specific reading on the technology/experiment and a few others on cleaning/working with/analyzing these data!

Q1: **What's the difference between etiology and pathogenesis? Are they synonyms?**  
A1: Not _quite_ synonyms, but they're closely related! Both refer to explaining disease/disorder development. The difference is that etiology refers to how a disease/disorder _begins_ and pathogenesis refers to how a disease/disorder _plays out_ over the course of time
